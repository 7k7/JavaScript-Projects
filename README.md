## Projects

- [Pizza Menu](#)

- [Calculator](#)

### Pizza Menu

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a selection of various toppings.
Users receive the total price based their pizza and toppings selection. 

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is about the classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first
and then users are off playing the game. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated
with music and flashing lights.

### Calculator

This project is based on a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on this web version of a calculator.
